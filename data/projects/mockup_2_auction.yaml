description: Quickly track the break even of each lot coming through the auction ring. Take bias out of your purchasing decisions, and buy the cattle that gives you the best opportunity to make money. Simply enter in the weight of the group of cattle and project your rate of gain and decide your finishing weight goal. With those few variables track the auctioneers calls and track the financial opportunities. - **Performance Livestock Analytics**
